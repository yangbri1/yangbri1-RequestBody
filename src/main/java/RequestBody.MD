# Javalin Lab: Retrieving Data from the body of an HTTP Request

Now that we have learned how to create a webserver and define endpoints with Javalin, we need to learn how to
retrieve data from the HTTP requests.

The most common ways to retrieve data from the HTTP requests:
- Path parameters
- HTTP Request body

We have already learned in the previous last lab how to use path parameters. This lab is going to talk about 
retrieving data from the request body.

## HTTP Request Body

Clients can send data in the body of an HTTP request. The type of data varies but in this curriculum we will be passing json strings in the body of our HTTP Requests.


## Jackson
Since Java does not understand json, we need to convert that json string into a something that java understands (like a java object). Jackson is a dependency that we can add to our project to achieve just that.

Jackson utilizes a class called `ObjectMapper` and you can instantiate it as shown below:
```java
ObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper();
```

There are 2 methods defined in the `ObjectMapper` class that we will use:

- `om.readValue()`: converts json strings to java objects

- `om.writeValueAsString()`: converts java objects to json strings

## Steps to retrieve data from a JSON String to a Java object

Lets say we have the following POST endpoint which will send us a request with a body containing a JSON of a user shown 
above. We could get the json string in a String variable by utilizing the `ctx.body()` method.

```java
app.post("/user", ctx -> {
    String jsonString = ctx.body();
});
```

This is a good start, but we can utilize jackson to convert the request body into a java object.

```java
app.post("/user", ctx -> {
    //retrieve the json string from the request body
    String jsonString = ctx.body();

    //utilize jackson to convert the json string to a user object
    ObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper();
    User user = om.readValue(jsonString, User.class);
    
    //now we can use the 'user' response body as a Java object in whatever way we see fit.
        
    //eg: return the user as the response body, but also have Javalin convert it to JSON  
    ctx.json(user);    
});
```

NOTE: the `om.readValue()` method above takes in 2 arguments:

1. the json string that we are trying to convert

2. the class of the datatype that we are trying to convert the json string to



Now that we have the data in a java object, we can manipulate anyway we see fit. Let's say I want to change the first 
name from "Jobs" to "Jones" and then send the data back as a json string:

```java
app.post("/user", ctx ->{
        //retrieve the json string from the request body
        String jsonString=ctx.body();

        //utilize jackson to convert the json string to a user object
        ObjectMapper om=new ObjectMapper();
        User user=om.readValue(jsonString,User.class);

        //change the last name
        user.setLastname("Jones");

        //generate an HTTP response with the user object in the response body as a JSON.
        ctx.json(user);
        });
```

You're Done!
